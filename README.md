This is a trading automation application for Path of Exile.<br/>
With the application, you will be able to track profitable prices for trading.<br/>
The notification system will allow you to instantly respond to a profitable offer<br/>
To set up filters, just use the familiar [PoE Official Trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search), then copy and paste the link into the app to track price changes.<br/>
There is also support for [Poe.Trade](https://poe.trade/) (Not recommended to use, slower than [PoE Official Trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search))<br/>
